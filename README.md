Hello there. I am Yixiu, a graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

This is a portfolio of the interesting coding projects I was involved with.

- Yeo's Company industry attachment project (IPython notebook in this repo)
- Elderly Voice Research Project (link to repo on this project [here](https://github.com/melodicoder/Elderly-Voice-Research-Analysis-Project))
- EmpathIQ, a web application aimed at improving the communication skills of medical students when talking to patients. I was mainly involved with developing the backend features of processing the app user's facial emotions and providing feedback on his communication. (watch a demo of the application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7fu8V7UfE)). Footage courtesy of Gan Chin Song, leader of EmpathIQ.
